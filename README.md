# Obsidian Useful Widgets plugin

The intention of this plugin is to add the ability for users to insert simple, useful widgets via the command palette or hotkeys.

This is to address the need for widgets created by things like Periodic Notes and Homepage. Many people were using iframes of widgets designed for Notion, but I know that it's simpler, easier, and doesn't use as much outside tooling to create a plugin to insert these widgets instead.
